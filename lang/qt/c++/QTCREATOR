TARGET = hello_world
QT = core gui
EOT
File > New file or project > C++ > C++ source file                  # Create a hello_world.cpp file with correct entries in .pro file
this operation add in project file
HEADERS += \

Q: What are shadow build? 
Qt has a wonderful option: you can build Qt depending on your need from the same source code in many different flavors.
It come with a -prefix option in its configure script, which will allow you to install Qt in a directory of your choice. E.g. if you want to build a different version of Qt with or without webkit, you can do so by using the -no-webkit option in configure and by defining a different installation path using -prefix.
This way you build different versions of Qt on your development machine from the same source code.
Unfortunately, this option is not available on Windows.

Q: How to set up shadow builds on Mac and Linux
Look at the project build settings

Q:

Q: Deployment (install)?
Projects > Run Settings > Deployment > Add (Build tarball and install on linux host)

Create a linux Device
    Linux Device > Add > Generic Linux Device > Configuration Setup
    Name of configuration: loclahost
    IP address: 127.0.0.1                               # <-- You can do remote install from local machine !!!
    Username: Root
    Authentication: Password (Key available!)
    Password: XXXX (key file otherwise)
!!! QtCreator immediately test the configuration
Go to your project file, and see the code:
unix:!symbian:!maemo5:isEmpty(MEEGO_VERSION_MAJOR) {
    target.path = /home/local/epics/bin
    INSTALLS += target
}
Then add
INSTALLS += <binaries to install>
Then DEPLOY !
!!! TO deploy, in menu select Build > Deploy all
