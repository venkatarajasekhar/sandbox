# Qt Fundammentals

Q: QOBJECT? What is that?
QObject is the most basic class in Qt. Most of classes in Qt inherit from this class. 
QObject provides some very powerful capabilities like :

* object name : you can set a name, as a string, to an object, and search for objects by names.
* parenting system (described in the following section)
* signals and slots 
* event management

Q: QWidget? what is that?
Widgets are able to respond to events, use parenting system and signals and slots mechanism, 
all inherit from QObject. The most basic widget is the QWidget. 
QWidget contains most properties that are used to describe a window, or a widget, 
like position and size, mouse cursor, tooltips etc.

# Signal and slots

Q: Use signals and slots to Transmitting information?
The signals and slots mechanism is useful to respond to buttons clicks, but it can do much more than that. 
For example, It can also be used communicate information. 
Lets say while playing a song, a progress bar is needed to show how much time remains before the song is over. 
A media player might have a class that is used to check the progress of the media. 
An instance of this class might periodically send a tick signal, with the progress. 
This signal can be connected to a QProgressBar, that can be used to display the progress.

# QWidgets

Q: How to set a stylesheet in designer for QWIdget?
background-color:black;
in the QWidget.stylesheet property
!!! The designer display should update accordingly
!!! You can also use a filename

Q: Can any property of the widget be altered?
Yes, by using the 'qproperty' keyword. As such, setting the stylesheet property to
qproperty-geometry; rect(10 10 100 100);
would move the widget to position 10,10 and give it a size of 100,100
