Q: How to set a stylesheet in designer for q QWIdget?
background-color:black;
in the QWidget.stylesheet property
!!! The designer display should update accordingly
!!! You can also use a filename

Q: Can any property of the widget be altered?
Yes, by using the 'qproperty' keyword. As such, setting the stylesheet property to
qproperty-geometry; rect(10 10 100 100);
would move the widget to position 10,10 and give it a size of 100,100
