# TOMCAT

Q: What is Tomcat?
Tomcat is the open source implementation of JSP.
Like JSP, it uses WAR files.

Q: What is JSP?
JSP = implementation by Sun of a Java web framework called Java Server Page
JSP use the MVC (model, view, controller design)

Q: What is the main configuration file for tomcat?
TOMCAT_TOP/conf/server.xml
In that file, you configure on which port the tomcat server/process is running

Q: What are war files?
A WAR file (or Web application ARchive[1]) is a JAR file used to distribute a collection of 
JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, static Web pages 
(HTML and related files) and other resources that together constitute a Web application.
War files are jar file with the structure to be used as webapp in JSP (Java Server Page)
unzip <file.war>
or
jar xf <file.war>
!!! Beware, the files are extracted directly in the current working directory !!!
!!! You can edit war files with vim !!!

WAR files placed in ${TOMCAT_VERSION_FOLDER}/webapps  (or TOMCAT_INSTANCE/webapps)
To modify them, (1) extract them, (2) modify, (3) zip'em 
jar xf .../mgmt.war
also possible
unzip .../mgmt.war 
<modification>

Q: Where is the tomcat management interface?
systemctl status tomcat.service
server.xml is the tomcat server configuration file

Q: HOw to start the server ?
.../catalina.sh run             # Run in the background
.../catalina.sh start           # Run in the foreground

Q: Important tomcat environment variables?
CATALINA_HOME   May point at your Catalina "build" directory.
CATALINA_BASE   (Optional) Base directory for resolving dynamic portions of a Catalina installation.  If not present, resolves to the same directory that CATALINA_HOME points to.
CATALINA_OUT    (Optional) Full path to a file where stdout and stderr will be redirected. Default is $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.out
CATALINA_OPTS   (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "start", "run" or "debug" command is executed. Include here and not in JAVA_OPTS all options, that should only be used by Tomcat itself, not by the stop process, the version command etc. Examples are heap size, GC logging, JMX ports etc.
CATALINA_TMPDIR (Optional) Directory path location of temporary directory the JVM should use (java.io.tmpdir).  Defaults to $CATALINA_BASE/temp.
JAVA_HOME       Must point at your Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. Required to run the with the "debug" argument.
JRE_HOME        Must point at your Java Runtime (JRE) installation. Defaults to JAVA_HOME if empty. If JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME are both set, JRE_HOME is used.
JAVA_OPTS       (Optional) Java runtime options used when any command is executed. Include here and not in CATALINA_OPTS all options, that should be used by Tomcat and also by the stop process, the version command etc. Most options should go into CATALINA_OPTS.
JAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS (Optional) Lists of of colon separated directories containing some jars in order to allow replacement of APIs created outside of the JCP (i.e. DOM and SAX from W3C). It can also be used to update the XML parser implementation. Defaults to $CATALINA_HOME/endorsed.
JPDA_TRANSPORT  (Optional) JPDA transport used when the "jpda start" command is executed. The default is "dt_socket".
JPDA_ADDRESS    (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start" command is executed. The default is 8000.
JPDA_SUSPEND    (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start" command is executed. Specifies whether JVM should suspend execution immediately after startup. Default is "n".  
JPDA_OPTS       (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start" command is executed. If used, JPDA_TRANSPORT, JPDA_ADDRESS, and JPDA_SUSPEND are ignored. Thus, all required jpda options MUST be specified. The default is: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=$JPDA_TRANSPORT, address=$JPDA_ADDRESS,server=y,suspend=$JPDA_SUSPEND
CATALINA_PID    (Optional) Path of the file which should contains the pid of the catalina startup java process, when start (fork) is used
LOGGING_CONFIG  (Optional) Override Tomcat's logging config file Example (all one line) LOGGING_CONFIG="-Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties"
LOGGING_MANAGER (Optional) Override Tomcat's logging manager Example (all one line) LOGGING_MANAGER="-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager"

Q: What is the commons-daemon?
The common daemon is like procServ.
It watches for tomcat processes and make sure they are running.
If not, it restarts them.
The daemon is listed as jsvc ( ps -lef | grep jsvc)
When using the commons-daemon, they are 2 jsvc process for each initial tomcat process
!!! The first jsvc is for monitoring, the second is the process itself

Q: How to install the commons-daemon?
The daemon is part of the tomcat distribution. The daemon is tar.gz'ed in <tomcat>/bin
To install:
1/ untar it
2/ install Oracle JDK
3/ cd <tomcat>/bin/commons-daemon-1.0.10-native-src/unix;
   ./configure --with-java=/home/clsfs/epics/2/git/epics-opis/cls1/opis/archiver/normalstart/jdk1.7.0_17
   make
4/ jsvc is created
5/ cp jsvc <tomcat>/bin
!!! JDK is the Java development kit and is used only for compilation
