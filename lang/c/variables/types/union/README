WHAT IS A UNION

A union, is a collection of variables of different types, just like a structure. However, with unions, you can only store information in one field at any one time.

You can picture a union as like a chunk of memory that is used to store variables of different types. Once a new value is assigned to a field, the existing data is wiped over with the new data.

A union can also be viewed as a variable type that can contain many different variables (like a structure), but only actually holds one of them at a time (not like a structure). This can save memory if you have a group of data where only one of the types is used at a time. The size of a union is equal to the size of it's largest data member. In other words, the C compiler allocates just enough space for the largest member. This is because only one member can be used at a time, so the size of the largest, is the most you will need. Here is an example:

...
union time
{

    long simpleDate;
    double perciseDate;

}mytime;
....
The union above could be used to either store the current time (in seconds) to hold time accurate to a second. Or it could be used to hold time accurate to a millisecond. Presumably there are times when you would want one or the other, but not both. This declaration should look familiar. It is the same as a struct definition, but with the keyword union instead of struct.
