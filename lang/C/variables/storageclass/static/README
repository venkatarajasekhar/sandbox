EXTERN
-------

Using extern is only of relevance when the program you're building consists of multiple source files linked together, where some of the variables defined, for example, in source file file1.c need to be referenced in other source files, such as file2.c.

It is important to understand the difference between defining a variable and declaring a variable:

    A variable is defined when the compiler allocates the storage for the variable.
    A variable is declared when the compiler is informed that a variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the storage for the variable at that point.

You may declare a variable multiple times (though once is sufficient); you may only define it once within a given scope.
