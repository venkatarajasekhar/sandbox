char	-	A single byte (8bits). Signed unless specified as unsigned
int	-	An integer which is typically the size of native integer values on the host system. 
		Commonly found in either 16 or 32 bit sizes. Signed unless spcified as unsigned
float	-	A single-precision floating-point value, typically expressed in 32bits (4 bytes). Always signed
double	-	A double-precision floating-point value, typically expressed in 64bits (8 bytes). Always signed.

unsigned char	-	1 byte 	-	0 to 255
signed char	-	1	-	-128 to 127
char		-	1	-	-128 to 127
short(int)	-	2	-	-32768 to 32767
unsigned short(int)	2	-	0 to 65535
unsigned int	-	4	-	0 to 4 294 967 295
