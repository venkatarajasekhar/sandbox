Composition 
* An object include other objects
* those included object can be initialized with initilizers!
    * if no initializer is provide, the object is initialized by the DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR
    * if there is no default constructor ==> Compilation error


BEST PRACTICE
-------------
If a class member is an object of another class (as hireDate for employee)
that object should still be private, ike all other data members.
(Otherwise id does violate the encapsulation and hiding of the containing class's implementation)
(i.e. user wil lbe tempted to interact directly with that object)
