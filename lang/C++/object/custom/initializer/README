Member initializer 
------------------
* are executed before the body of the constructor
* multiple initializers are separated by commas.
* An object can be created and passed to the constructor as a reference and init in the initializer
    - use copy constructor? It seems ...
* Are initializer only used in constructor? Well, .... 


!!! Not providing a 

base-class initializer
----------------------
BasePlusCommissionEmployee::BasePlusCommissionEmployee(
    const string &first, const string &last, const string & ssn,
    double sales, double rate, double salary)
    : CommissionEmployee(first, last, ssn, sales, rate)             // explicit class base-class constructor
{
    ...
}
