PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE
----------------------------

MEMBER FUCNTION WITH CONST PARAMETER
------------------------------------
==> The parameter is not changed in body of the member function

CONST MEMBER FUNCTION
---------------------
ex: void Time::getMinute() const {}
* A const member function can NOT call non-const member function
* A const member function can NOT modify a data member of the object 

!!! A const function is declared as such only when const keyword appears.
!!! A non-const function that doesn't change data is still not a const function

CONST OBJECT
------------
ex: const Time noon(12,0,0);
* Invoking a non-const member function on a const object is a compilation error
* A const object can NOT use mutator (set functions)

!!!! 483: Remember a program can invoke only the const member functions of a const object.

CONST DATA MEMBER
-----------------
ex .... private const usec;
A const data member needed to be initialized with an initializer
the const-ness of the parameter is valid thereafter!
int MyClass::MyMemberFunction(int c, const Array &arrayToCopy)
    : myConstVar(c), myConstVar2(45), size(attayToCopy.size)            <-- assign c to myConstVar
{
}
