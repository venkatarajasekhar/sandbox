A friend of a class is a function which can access its private members.
An instance is passed as an argument of that function 
ex: setX(counter, 8) instead of counter.setX(8)

!!! A friend function is NOT a member of the class (although it is declared with the class declaration )
!!! A friend is a C-style, stnad alone function 

Q: Are copy construstructor friend function?

    * If A is friend with B, B may not be friend with A

Is not transitic
    * If A is friend with B, B is friend with C ==> A is not necessarily friend with C
