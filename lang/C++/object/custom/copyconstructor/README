A copy constructor is what does a memberwize assignment
If private member of a class are of regular type (no pointers and memory allocation), then a default? copyconstructor is in place!

* copyconstructor
    Of an existing class (e.g. vector)

* memberwise
    With custom (but simple) class
    !!! The compiler provides a DEFAULT COPY CONSTRUCTOR

* Array474 ( Custom Copy Construct)
    Beware when pointers are copied by default copy constructor
    Otherwise both object points to the SAME DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED MEMORY (with new)
    A destructor is probably needed with a 'delete' instruction


COPY CONSTRUCTORS
-----------------

Are invoked whenever a copy of an object is needed, such as in
* passing an object by VALUE to a function
* returning an object by VALUE from a function 
* initializing an object with a copy of another object of the same class


!!! The argument to a copy constructor should be a const reference to allow a const object to be copied

!!! A copy constructor must receive its argument by reference, not by value (Otherwise infinite recursion!)

COPY CONSTRUCTOR AND INITIALIZER
--------------------------------
Are copy constructor used in initializer? It seems...
