REFERENCE PURPOSE
-----------------
Used to pass object to member functions (methods)
ex: copy constructor!


==> The return value as a reference means that the object.method() can be changed as if the object was there in place




POOR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE
--------------------------

A public function return a reference to private data.
The private data can be changed by using the reference as a lvalue ( lvalue = rvalue)

!!! private data should not be accessible to outside of class/instance
