Name mangling is not desirable when linking C modules with libraries or object files compiled with a C++ compiler. To prevent the C++ compiler from mangling the name of a function, you can apply the extern "C" linkage specifier to the declaration or declarations, as shown in the following example:

extern "C" {
   int f1(int);
   int f2(int);
   int f3(int);
};

This declaration tells the compiler that references to the functions f1, f2, and f3 should not be mangled.

The extern "C" linkage specifier can also be used to prevent mangling of functions that are defined in C++ so that they can be called from C. For example,

extern "C" {
   void p(int){
      /* not mangled */
   }
};
