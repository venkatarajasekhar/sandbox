Q: What is a linked list?
A C-structure with a pointer to the next object.

Q: What is a hash table?
A hash table is an array of linked lists.
That array has a fixed size, but is large.
A hash table has a hash function that give for each key an index in the array.
In case of collision (2 keys have the same index), they are chained in a linked list.

In general, the hash is large enough that the retrieval of data is not function of the number of keys o(1)
==> constant retrieve time

Q: What is a tree?
A C-struct with X children pointers.
Are sorted
Lookups are slower that with hash table ie log(n) with n = number of element in a tree

# IPC

Q: What is an IPC?
Interprocess communication, i.e ways for processes to communicate

Q: What are the 10 main IPC methods?
File
Signal
socket
Message queue
Pipe                    - POSIX
Named pipe              - POSIX
Semaphore (and mutex)   - POSIX
Shared memory           - POSIX
Message passing         - aka shared nothing
Memory-mapped file      - POSIX

Q: File ?

Q: Socket?
Q: What is the difference between a INET and a UNIX socket?
AF_INET uses the TCP/IP protocol. AF_UNIX creates filesystem objects and it only works between processes on the same host. AF_UNIX is much faster than AF_INET.
Q: Message queue?
Q: Pipe ?
Q: Named pipe ?
Q: Semaphore (and mutex) ?
Mutex           = binary semaphore
Reentrant mutex = Mutex with a count, where owner of lock can relock and increase count (recursive locking!)
Semaphore       = Restaurant analogy

Q: Shared memory ?
Q: Message passing ?
Q: Memory-mapped file ?

# Remote procedure calls (RPC)

Q: What are RPCs?
There implementation use sockets
= Call a remote procedure/program
Input parameters are well defined
Ouput as well

Q: In layman's term?
You use Outlook 2002 to look at your e-mail, right? The
contents of your Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items,
Contacts, Calendar, et al do not actually reside on the
hard drive of your LOCAL computer, though. Right? They
actually reside on the hard drives of the Exchange Server,
a REMOTE computer.

RPC allows you to use an application ( like Outlook ) to
look at something located at a remote location as if it
were local.

Same can be said for looking at your "home directory". It
is located on the File Server, right. Yet you can look at
it AS IF it were on your local computer.

Q: Program using RPC?
NFS ;-)

Q: RPC standard?
RPC is a method. There is no RPC standard.
As a result, several RPC (protocol) have been imlpemented and are incompatible.
