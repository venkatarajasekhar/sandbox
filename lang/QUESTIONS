Q: What is a linked list?
A C-structure with a pointer to the next object.

Q: What is a hash table?
A hash table is an array of linked lists.
That array has a fixed size, but is large.
A hash table has a hash function that give for each key an index in the array.
In case of collision (2 keys have the same index), they are chained in a linked list.

In general, the hash is large enough that the retrieval of data is not function of the number of keys o(1)
==> constant retrieve time

Q: What is a tree?
A C-struct with X children pointers.
Are sorted
Lookups are slower that with hash table ie log(n) with n = number of element in a tree

# IPC

Q: What is an IPC?
Interprocess communication, i.e ways for processes to communicate

Q: What are the 10 main IPC methods?
File
Signal
socket
Message queue
Pipe                    - POSIX
Named pipe              - POSIX
Semaphore (and mutex)   - POSIX
Shared memory           - POSIX
Message passing         - aka shared nothing
Memory-mapped file      - POSIX

Q: File ?

Q: Socket?
Q: Message queue?
Q: Pipe ?
Q: Named pipe ?
Q: Semaphore (and mutex) ?
Mutex           = binary semaphore
Reentrant mutex = Mutex with a count, where owner of lock can relock and increase count (recursive locking!)
Semaphore       = Restaurant analogy

Q: Shared memory ?
Q: Message passing ?
Q: Memory-mapped file ?

# Remote procedure calls (RPC)

Q: What are RPCs?
There implementation use sockets
= Call a remote procedure/program
Input parameters are well defined
Ouput as well
