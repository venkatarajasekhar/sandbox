Q: What is a linked list?
A C-structure with a pointer to the next object.

Q: What is a hash table?
A hash table is an array of linked lists.
That array has a fixed size, but is large.
A hash table has a hash function that give for each key an index in the array.
In case of collision (2 keys have the same index), they are chained in a linked list.

In general, the hash is large enough that the retrieval of data is not function of the number of keys o(1)
==> constant retrieve time

Q: What is a tree?
A C-struct with X children pointers.
Are sorted
Lookups are slower that with hash table ie log(n) with n = number of element in a tree
