Q: What is web page Authentication?
When a page requires a password to be viewed.
This is not an encryption key

Q: What are Error 401 and realms?
If a page requires authentication then the error code is 401. Included in the response headers will be a 'WWW-authenticate' header. 
This tells us the authentication scheme the server is using for this page and also something called a realm. 
It is rarely just a single page that is protected by authentication but a section - a 'realm' of a website. 
The name of the realm is included in this header line.

The 'WWW-Authenticate' header line looks like WWW-Authenticate: SCHEME realm="REALM".

For example, if you try to access the popular website admin application cPanel your browser will be sent a header that looks like : WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="cPanel"

If the client already knows the username/password for this realm then it can encode them into the request headers and try again. 
If the username/password combination are correct, then the request will succeed as normal. i
If the client doesn't know the username/password it should ask the user. i
This means that if you enter a protected 'realm' the client effectively has to request each page twice. 
The first time it will get an error code and be told what realm it is attempting to access - the client 
can then get the right username/password for that realm (on that server) and repeat the request.

HTTP is a 'stateless' protocol. 
This means that a server using basic authentication won't 'remember' you are logged in [5] and will need to be sent the right header for every protected page you attempt to access.
