This is a simple example of how to subclass QWidget using sip. The resulting
python object appears as a subclass of qt.QWidget in python. The tricky part 
of this is invoking sip in the right way, and finding the sipQtFeatures.h file
(which is created in the PyQt build, but often omitted from prepackaged 
 binaries)
