Array484 (implicit conversion)
------------------------------
ANY SINGLE ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTOR CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A CONVERSION CONTRUCTOR !

The constructor is used sometimes as 'cast' operator,
If the constructor exist, it can turn an integer into an object.
UNLESS THE KEYWORD explicit is is specified

explicit Array(int = 10)

Check explicit in .../C++/command/explicit

Default constructor
-------------------
A default constructor is a constructor that can be run without any parameters (no parameters or all paramters have default values)

If a class DOES explicitly include a constructor, a default constructor is NOT provided.
If an explicit constructor exist and all of its parameters have default values, then it becomes the default constructor.

!!! In case of inheritance, if there is no default constructor (because a constructor exist but doesn't provide default values)
then you need to EXPLICTLY call the constructor with default parameters.
==> That call is done in the member initializer section !!

Inheritance and constructors
----------------------------
each classes needs to provide a constructor.
Constructors are not inherited
To us a base-class constructor in a derived class constructor, use the base-class constructor INITIALIZER !
