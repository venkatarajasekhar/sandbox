The function exit forces a program to terminate immediately and does NOT execute the desctructors of AUTOMATIC OBJECTS.
Q: What are automatic object?
Non-static object !


The function abort forces a program to terminate immediately without allowing the destructors of ANY obbjects to be called
(This includes the static objects)


LOCAL AUTOMATIC OBJECT
----------------------
==> The corresponding destructor is called when execution leaves the object's scope

STATIC OBJECT
-------------
The constructor for a STATIC object is called only once, when the execution first reaches the point where the object is defined
The corresponding destructor is called when the MAIN program terminates or the program calls function exit.
Global and static objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their creation.

END OF MAIN
------------
Destruct first automatic, then static, then global in reverse order of creation (for each category
