Every object has access to its own pointer classed : this.
'this' i
* is a C++ keyword
* is a CONST pointer!
    ex: Employee * const        <-- a constant pointer on a non constant object (itself!)


!!! 'this' is not passed (by the compiler) as an argument to STATIC function
because static function can be called without an instance
i.e: MyClass::MyStaticFunction()                            <-- not sure?
