A puclib inheritance
the derived class imember functions access rights are the same as in the base class 

protected:
derived class cannot access private data member of base class !!!
--> protected is a way to keep the data private from the outside world, but to make it accessible to derived class.

!!! protected variables are accessible directly (i.e without using a mutator or accessor)
==> THERE IS NO VALIDATION OF THE INPUT!

private:
When to keep member data private? When VALIDATION is required!
When name of the members is not set in stone (i.e. firstName is renamed first --> you need to go through code of all derived classes)
