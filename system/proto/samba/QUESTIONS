Q: How to install?
apt-get install samba

Q: Configuration file ?
/etc/samba/snb.conf

Q: Configure a share?
Let's assume that
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/share
sudo chown nobody.nogroup /srv/samba/share/         # <-- Check ownership !
In configuration file in [global] section
workgroup = LYNCEAN
...
security = user                         # Users to to have an account on the server (same UID, same password)
[share]                                 # Name of share (is share!)
    comment = Ubuntu File Server Share  # Comment in windows explorer
    path = /srv/samba/share             # Path to share on server
    browsable = yes                     # Can be navigated in windows explorer
    guest ok = no                       # Guest access not ok (login is required!)
    read only = no                      # Read only share?
    create mask = 0755                  # Mask for creation of files

Restart daemon to enable
sudo restart smbd
sudo restart nmbd

Q: How to access the newly created share?
useradd -M emayssat -u 516 -g 100       # <-- NO! You need a smbpasswd not a syste, password!
passwd emayssat                         
On the windows machine, go to IP and enter username and password
You should be able to browse the share
Run --> control userpasswords2

Q: How to create a smbuser?

Q: How to set a smbuser password?
../bin/smbpasswd -a emayssat    -> to change and set passwd
smbpasswd -e emayssat           -> to enable user

smbpasswd will change the passwd file that is specified in the samba configuration.
!!! it may not be the one you think it is.

Q: Content of smbpassword file?
root@footee:/export/it/samba/etc# more smbpasswd 
root:0:CD8D9541439194FEE72C57EF50F76A05:96F5F0FB3FD850C908BB7DB90388FA1F:[U          ]:LCT-40131C98:
