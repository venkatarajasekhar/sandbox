Q: nfs4 over nfs3 ?
nfs4  has the possibility of changing UID/GID
That is if a user doesn't exist on a client nfs, the UID/GID is changed to nobody/nobody
If that username exists, but with a different UID, then the UID is remapped at the server 
through idmapd
If username and UID exists and are the same, well they appear as the same!
!!! Don't like nfs4? Force nfs3 in the mount

foote:/exports/projects         /mnt/foote/projects     nfs     ro,nolock,auto,nouser,vers=3 0 0
