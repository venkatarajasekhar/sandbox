AUTH (Authentication)
The AUTH command is used to authenticate the client to the server. 
The AUTH command sends the clients username and password to the e-mail server. 
AUTH can be combined with some other keywords as PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5 (e.g. AUTH LOGIN) to use different login methods and different levels of security. 
 
The example below shows how AUTH LOGIN can be used to make an authenticated login:
 
S: 220 smtp.server.com Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready
C: EHLO client.example.com
S: 250-smtp.server.com Hello client.example.com
S: 250-SIZE 1000000
S: 250 AUTH LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
C: AUTH LOGIN
S: 334 VXNlcm5hbWU6
C: adlxdkej
S: 334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6
C: lkujsefxlj
S: 235 2.7.0 Authentication successful
 
After that the AUTH LOGIN command has been sent to the server, the server asks for username and password by sending BASE64 encoded text (questions) to the client. 
“VXNlcm5hbWU6” is the BASE64 encoded text for the word "Username" and “UGFzc3dvcmQ6” is the BASE64 encoded text for the word "Password" in the example above. 
The client sends username and password also using BASE64 encoding. 
"adlxdkej", in the example above, is a BASE64 encoded username and "lkujsefxlj" is a BASE64 encoded password.
To encode in base64, user
$ echo toto | base64
