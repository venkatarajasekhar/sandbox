Q: What is virtual memory?
virtual memory = hardware RAM + swap space
Swap 

Q: What is a ramdisk?
A virtual disk in the ram that is NEVER swapped to disk

Q: What is a tmpfs?
A ramdisk that can be swapped!

Q: What is swap?
The swap is a section of the hard disk drive that is used to swap the RAM.
SWapping occurs when the RAM is more than 80% (?) full.
Swapping = a section of the RAM is coping to the hard disk andi vice-versa
cat /proc/swaps
swapon -s
free -m
top

Q: How much disk space should be used for Swap space?
Rule of thumb:
Swap space == Equal RAM size (if RAM < 8GB)
Swap space == 0.50 times the size of RAM (if RAM > 8GB)
The reality is the amount of swap space a system needs is not really a function 
of the amount of RAM it has but rather the memory workload that is running on that system.


Q: What is shm?
/dev/shm is a good place for separate programs to communicate with each other. 
For example, one can implement a simple resource lock as a file in shared memory. 
It is fast because there is no disk access (although swap may occasionally happen). 
mount | grep shm
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)
cd /dev/shm/   <-- it is a filesystem !!!
/dev/shm frees you up from having to implement shared memory blocks yourself. 
You get (almost) all of the advantages of a shared memory block using stdio functions. 
It also means that SIMPLE BASH SCRIPTS can use shared memory to communicate with each other.
Everything done with shm could done with a “normal” file, but would be a slower.

# FILESYSTEM

Q: What is a inode?
tunefs? fsck?
Q: What is a soft link / hard link?
Q: Is a diretory a file?

Q: What is /proc?

Q: What is /sys ?
Q: Wat is fuse? gvfs?

Q: What is a volume group?
/dev/mapper/vg_cr1dev1-lv_home on /home type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Q: What is the difference between INET and UNIX socket?
AF_INET uses the TCP/IP protocol. AF_UNIX creates filesystem objects and it only works between processes on the same host. AF_UNIX is much faster than AF_INET.

Q: What is DBUS?
DBUS is a framework around UNIX socket used initially by KDE (and now other free desktop environments)
DBUs is middleware
Both one-to-one messaging and publish/subscribe communication are supported.
D-Bus is aware of user identities and does support flexible authentication mechanisms and access controls. The system bus may see traffic from and to any number of user identities.
