== BUSINESS CYCLE ==

projection < 5 years                <-- Not like Long Run

Why do we get recession?
Recession = Fall of GDP             <-- change from long run trajectory
Unemployment rate increase RAPIDLY during recession

Q: Link between GDP, inflation, and unemployment in the short run?

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSICAL BUSINESS CYCLE

CLASSICAL ==> regular sequence of events
    - Peak                          <-- maximum in the short run
    - Trough                        <-- (Trouf)
    - Peak

    Contraction = period between Peak and Trough
    Expansion   = period between Trough and Peak

!!! Expansion length > Contraction length?
!!! Continuous growth --> growth in GDP during expansion > losses in GDP during contraction

= Okun's Law = 
How costly is an economic contraction?
Could contraction be shortened or even eliminated?

RECESSION + EXPANSION are variations around the (growing) GDP trends 
Growth economics 
    - expansion? = GDP trends above real and observed GDP growth
    - contraction? = 

POTENTIAL GDP
    = y *
    - The flow of output (GDP) produced over a particular time period when productive resources (labor and capital) are being used at their "normal rates"
    - !!! GDP when there is no under-utilisation of resources AND no over-utilisation of resources 

UNEMPLOYMENT
    - different types of unemployment have different implication for the economy
        - frictional unemployment                       <-- always there
            - new graduate entry in labor force
            - switch between job
        - structural unemployment                       <-- always there
            - mismatch between skills of unemployed and skills required by companies
        - cyclical unemployment
            - due to business cycle
    !!! Natural rate of unemployment u* = frictional + structural unemployment + 0
    !!! Natural rate of unemployment u* = unemployment when cyclical unemployment = 0
    If u > u* ==> cyclical unemployment >0 
    If u < u* ==> cyclical unemployment <0          <-- overheating economy (lots of overtime, work on weekend, company hire people who do not fit exactly but who can contribute)


OUTPUT GAP
    = 100 . (y -y*)/ y*
    - If the output gap < 0 ==(GDP below potential GDP)==> contractionary output gap
    - If the output gap > 0 ==(GDP above potential GDP)==> contractionary output gap

OKUN's LAW                                                  <-- Empirical relationship
    Output GAP = - Beta . (u - u*)                  
        - Note the minus sign before Beta
        - (u - u*) is cyclical unemployment
        - Beta is function of the country (most often 1.5))
        - Beta for the same country can change overtime
