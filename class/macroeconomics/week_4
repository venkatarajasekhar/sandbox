== BUSINESS CYCLE ==

projection < 5 years                <-- Not like Long Run

Why do we get recession?
Recession = Fall of GDP             <-- change from long run trajectory
Unemployment rate increase RAPIDLY during recession

Q: Link between GDP, inflation, and unemployment in the short run?

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSICAL BUSINESS CYCLE

CLASSICAL ==> regular sequence of events
    - Peak                          <-- maximum in the short run
    - Trough                        <-- (Trouf)
    - Peak

    Contraction = period between Peak and Trough
    Expansion   = period between Trough and Peak

!!! Expansion length > Contraction length?
!!! Continuous growth --> growth in GDP during expansion > losses in GDP during contraction

= Okun's Law = 
How costly is an economic contraction?
Could contraction be shortened or even eliminated?

RECESSION + EXPANSION are variations around the (growing) GDP trends 
Growth economics 
    - expansion? = GDP trends above real and observed GDP growth
    - contraction? = 

POTENTIAL GDP
    = y *
    - The flow of output (GDP) produced over a particular time period when productive resources (labor and capital) are being used at their "normal rates"
    !!! GDP when there is no under-utilisation of resources AND no over-utilisation of resources 
    !!! Potential gap is difficult to measure because not observable

UNEMPLOYMENT
    - different types of unemployment have different implication for the economy
        - frictional unemployment                       <-- always there
            - new graduate entry in labor force
            - switch between job
        - structural unemployment                       <-- always there
            - mismatch between skills of unemployed and skills required by companies
        - cyclical unemployment
            - due to business cycle
    !!! Natural rate of unemployment u* = frictional + structural unemployment + 0
    !!! Natural rate of unemployment u* = unemployment when cyclical unemployment = 0
    If u > u* ==> cyclical unemployment >0 
    If u < u* ==> cyclical unemployment <0          <-- overheating economy (lots of overtime, work on weekend, company hire people who do not fit exactly but who can contribute)

    !!! Natural rate of unemployment is difficult to measure, because is not observable!
    !!! Use 4.5% for the US                         <-- May change overtime ?


OUTPUT GAP
    = 100 . (y -y*)/ y*
    - If the output gap < 0 ==(GDP below potential GDP)==> contractionary output gap
    - If the output gap > 0 ==(GDP above potential GDP)==> contractionary output gap
    !!! Output gap is function of the potential GDP, which is difficult to measure

OKUN's LAW                                                  <-- Empirical relationship
    Output GAP = - Beta . (u - u*)                  
        - Note the minus sign before Beta
        - Note output gap is a %
        - (u - u*) is cyclical unemployment (as a percentage)
        - Beta is function of the country (close to 1.5 for the USi, 1.47)
        - Beta for the same country can change overtime 

    Economic cost of a contraction                          <-- How much income is lost as a result of a contraction

Keynes key insight: Macro vs Micro
Demand and supply analysis
    - Price vs Quantity  2d plot
    - Demand: Downward sloping line
        - At high price, demand is low
        - At low price, demand is high
    - Supply curve: Producer's decision making 
    - equilibrium
    
    - demand shift 
        ex: hot day     ==> demand for ice scream increases ==> price and quantity increase
        ex: cold day    ==> demand for ice scream drops     ==> price and quantity decrease
        ==> Price increase on hit days, and decrease on cold days
    - supply shift
        A positive shift in the supply of a good would cause prices to decrease and the quantity to increase

!!! But why isn't price for EVERYTHING changing on a DAILY basis? 
    ==> PRICE RIGIDITY
    ==> AS if SUPPLY CURVE was flat 
        - Equilibrium doesn't adjust due to shift in demand
        - (i.e price of ice scream does not change ifunction of weather and on a daily basis)   
        - P stay the same, but Q sold changes       <-- in short term, P doesn't have as much information as Q does

!!! The difference between short and long run is price adjustment.

BASIC KENEYSIAN MODEL

PLANNED AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE, PAE
    = Flow of total PLANNED spending, in aggregate, on final goods and services
    !!! PLANNED spending is not necessarily was is spent !!! 
        - household
        - firms 
        - government
        - foreign sectors

AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE, AE = Y
AGGREGATE OUTPUT, AO = Y
    = aggregate output (produced by firms)          <-- What firms are expecting to sell
    = The flow of total ACTUAL spending, in aggregate on final goods and services
    !!! ACTUAL spending may be higher or lower than PLANNED expenditure

SHORT RUN MACROECONOMIC EQUILIRIUM
    !!! Equilibrium = when economy is at rest?
    = A situation in which all spending plans are realised exactly, i.e. PAE = Y
        - What firm produces is what is being sold

SHORT RUN MACROECONOMIC DISEQUILIBRIUM
    = A situation in which all spending plans are not realised exactly,
        - PAE > Y ==> firms UNEXPECTEDLY decrease inventories   (demand much stronger than anticipated)
        - PAE < Y ==> firms UNEXPECTEDLY increase inventories   (demand is weaker than anticipated, lot of unsold goods!)
     

Y                                                   <-- GDP
    = AE                                            <-- Aggregate Expenditure
    = PAE + unexpected changes in inventories       <-- .... + UNEXPECTED INVESTMENT, Iu
    = Cd +Ip +G +X +Iu                              <-- I = planned investment, Ip + unexpected investment, Iu
    !!! MODEL SIMPLIFICATION: Assume that households, government, foreigners always have their plans realised
    !!! MODEL SIMPLIFICATION: Assume that firms may or may not have their plans realised

Model: 2d plot PAE=f(Y)
    - draw the 45 degree line                       <-- important line, where Y=PAE     (points of equilibrium!)
    - Plot the potential GDP, Y*                    <-- Y* is coming from 'growth economics', determined from outside the model (i.e. an exogenous variable)

!!! Exogenous variable = a variable determined from outside of the model
    ex: Potential GDP, Y*, determined by forces outside of the short run model
!!! An endogenous Variable = a variable determined from within the model (built in the model)
    ==> Model explain the variable
    ex: PAE=f(Y) equilibrium is endogenous
!!! Keynes: In the short run, Endogenous and exogenous equilibrium need not be the same
One of Keynes’ insight into the economy was that the endogenous forces that determine equilibrium may not be related to the exogenous forces that determine potential GDP.
