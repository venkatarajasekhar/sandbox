price ~ social value (equality valid in short term)
nominal GDP = quantities * price

Q: If nominal GDP drops is it because price drops or quantities drops?
The problem with nominal GDP is that it disguises which variable, price or quantity, 
the driving factor behind the change in GDP.
==> Use real GDP

!!! A real GDP requires a base period for base prices
--> prices are inflation adjusted
--> remove the effect of price changes

A CHANGE IN REAL GDP REFLECT A CHANGE IN QUANTITY
!!! The base period used should be 'close' to all the years that are included in the real GDP
!!! It is so because price ~ social value (in short, medium term)

PRODUCTION = EXPENDITURE = INCOME = GDP

# GDP and HAPPINESS

Q: Does GDP tell us about social welfare?
Q: is growing the output of a country making people happier?
!!! Rising income doesn't lead to rising income !!!
--> economists are focusing on the wrong thing

Quality of healthcare is higher in countries with higher GDP

Feel good = money + do what is right !
Happiness and pyramid of maslow --> redistribution to the poorest increase happiness

# LONG-RUN ECONOMIC GROWTH

!!! Long-run economic growth refers to any period of time from decades, to 40-50 years, 100 y, all the above!

real GDP / capita between 1870 and 2010 
==> exponential growth !

Yt = Yo.(1+alpha)^t         <-- Yo = GDP at base year, t is # of years since base year
                            <-- alpha ~ 0.02 for USA

!!! Long Run forces : deep structural aspect of the economy affect growth (i.e. technology, demographics, etc)

real GDP / capita 
    = Y / population
    = Y / labor force       *   labor force / population
    = real GDP / worker     *   proportion of population working
    = average productivity  *   participation rate
        

FIRM = exist to bring together factors of production to generate an output (black box model!)
Firm =
    = labour + capital                                                      <-- primary factors of production
    + technology (level of technology) + skills of workers + climate ....   <-- secondary factor of production
    + level of corruption + access to capital + number of computers per office ... <-- more secondary factors

!!! capital = plant and equipment (must be tangible infrastructure)    
!!! secondary factor of production = anything that affect production, but the primary factors of production

== PRODUCTION FUNCTION ==

CRS =   Constant Returns to Scale
    =   If you scale capital (K) and labor (L) by same factor you * output per same factor
        (i.e if you double amount of capital and labor, output doubles)
                <-- secondary factors of production are kept constant
!!! Look at diagonal, should increase linearily
    - k = 1 , l = 1 ==> output = x 
    - k = 2 , l = 2 ==> output = 2 * x 
    - k = 3 , l = 3 ==> output = 3 * x 


!!! If an economy is characterised with INCREASING Returns to Scale; then if both capital and labour increase by a factor of 3, what do we expect output to increase by?  A factor of more than 3
    
Diminishing marginal productivity of capital (k) 
    = smaller and smaller increase in the output as we increase k (holding labor and everything else constant)

Diminishing marginal productivity of labor (l) 
    = smaller and smaller increase in the output as we increase l (holding capital and everything else constant)

!!! CRS and Diminishing marginal productivity are not mutually exclusive
!!! In CRS, you change both the capital and labor, while in DMP you change only one of them.


y = A.f(k,l)                <-- k is capital, l is labor 
    - this function is the production function
    - real variables are lowercase (macroeconomics convention)
    - A is called the TFP or Total Factor Productivity
    - A represents secondary factors of production (anything that affect production outside of k and l)
        ( A includes available technology, managerial nous, level of corruption, etc)
    !!! 2 firms with same k and l different in amount of output due to A
    !!! The higher output for the same k and l, the higher the A
    !!! A doesn't include 'number of computers per office' as is a capital factor of production.

(Last video on production function)
Model: 3d surface A.f(k,l) is simplified by 2d-projection: 

y=f(k) With labor (l) and total factor productivity (A) fixed 
    - starts at (0,0)
    - derivative at 0 is large (+oo?)
    - clearly shows diminishing marginal productivity (derivative drops to 0)
    ==> curved shape 
    !!! If total factor productivity (A) improve, output increase (final plateau increase)

Same plot but with per capita. Eg y/l = f(k/l)
    - assume everybody in the population works
    - y/l is output per worker/capita       <-- per capita income, average productivity
    - k/l is capital labor ratio            <-- capital available for people when show up for work
    ==> increases in  k/l results in increases of y/l
    !!! If total factor productivity (A) improve, output increase (final plateau increase)

!!! Close to (0,0), this is an emerging country
!!! Close to (+oo, plateau), this is a mature economy
==> Diminishing marginal productivity of capital tell us that more capital for a developed economy doesn't help that much 
==> Improving the total factor of productivity (A), leads to a larger increase for DEVELOPED ECONOMIES compared to emerging ones
==> What needs to be done to fix an economy is function of its development stage

1/ boost access to capital, increase capital stocks ( increase capital / labor ratio )
2/ improvement of infrastructure and secondary factors of production 

Emerging economies with shorter histories of economic growth tend to be located closer to the origin in a model of two-dimensional per capita production. 
At these points, the gradient of the production function curve is relatively steep, 
and changes to the capital-labour ratio result in relatively large changes to per capita output.

!!! You cannot say anything about the Constant Return of Scale (CRS) but looking at the 2d projection ?
!!! For CRS, you need to change capital and labor at the same time but the same factor
!!! ??? For K/L = 1, ... ???
