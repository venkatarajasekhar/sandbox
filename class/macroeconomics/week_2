price ~ social value (equality valid in short term)
nominal GDP = quantities * price

Q: If nominal GDP drops is it because price drops or quantities drops?
==> Use real GDP

!!! A real GDP requires a base period for base prices
--> prices are inflation adjusted
--> remove the effect of price changes

A CHANGE IN REAL GDP REFLECT A CHANGE IN QUANTITY
!!! The base period used should be 'close' to all the years that are included in the real GDP
!!! It is so because price ~ social value (in short, medium term)

PRODUCTION = EXPENDITURE = INCOME = GDP

# GDP and HAPPINESS

Q: Does GDP tell us about social welfare?
Q: is growing the output of a country making people happier?
!!! Rising income doesn't lead to rising income !!!
--> economists are focusing on the wrong thing

Quality of healthcare is higher in countries with higher GDP

Feel good = money + do what is right !
Happiness and pyramid of maslow --> redistribution to the poorest increase happiness

# LONG-RUN ECONOMIC GROWTH

real GDP / capita between 1870 and 2010 
==> exponential growth !

Yt = Yo.(1+alpha)^t         <-- Yo = GDP at base year, t is # of years since base year
                            <-- alpha ~ 0.02 for USA

!!! Long Run forces : deep structural aspect of the economy affect growth (i.e. technology, demographics, etc)

real GDP / capita 
    = Y / population
    = Y / labor force       *   labor force / population
    = real GDP / worker     *   proportion of population working
    = average productivity  *   participation rate
        

FIRM = exist to bring together factors of production to generate an output (black box model!)
Firm =
    = labour + capital                                                      <-- primary factors of production
    + technology (level of technology) + skills of workers + climate ....   <-- secondary factor of production
    + level of corruption + access to capital + number of computers per office ... <-- more secondary factors

!!! capital = plant and equipment (must be tangible infrastructure)    
!!! secondary factor of production = anything that affect production, but the primary factors of production

== PRODUCTION FUNCTION ==

CRS =   Constant Returns to Scale
    =   If you scale capital (K) and labor (L) by same factor you * output per same factor
        (i.e if you double amount of capital and labor, output doubles)
                <-- secondary factors of production are kept constant
!!! Look at diagonal, should increase linearily
    
Diminishing marginal productivity of capital (k) 
    = smaller and smaller increase in the output as we increase k (holding labor and everything else constant)

Diminishing marginal productivity of labor (l) 
    = smaller and smaller increase in the output as we increase l (holding capital and everything else constant)

y = A.f(k,l)                <-- k is capital, l is labor 
    - real variables are lowercase (macroeconomics convention)
    - A is called the TFP or Total Factor Productivity
    - A represents secondary factors of production (anything that affect production outside of k and l)
        ( A includes available technology, managerial nous, level of corruption, etc)
    !!! 2 firms with same k and l different in amount of output due to A
    !!! The higher output for the same k and l, the higher the A
    !!! A doesn't include 'number of computers per office' as is a capital factor of production.

(Last video on production function)
Model: 3d surface A.f(k,l) is simplified by 2d-projection: 

y=f(k) With labor (l) and A fixed 
    - starts at (0,0)
    - derivative at 0 is large (+oo?)
    - clearly shows diminishing marginal productivity (derivative drops to 0)
    ==> curved shape
