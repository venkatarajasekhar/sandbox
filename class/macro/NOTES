market:
demand matches offer
--> price are powerful signals
A market economy allocates its resources through a price system
Resources allocated by the Government is known as a control or planned economy.

Economics is a discipline fundamentally about Making decisions regarding scarce resources we have and allocating them in the most efficient manner

Keynesian Economics is concerned with: Instances of market failure providing the Government with scope to intervene with macroeconomic policies to achieve better outcomes


MACROECONOMICS:
shift the focus from individuals to aggregates

The first Fundamental Theorem of Welfare:
    - decentralization decision making from price signals
    - optimal allocation                    <-- Is allocation optimal? If not, reallocation desired
    - Pareto optimality ( A decision is considered Pareto Optimal when: It is not possible to reallocate resources to make an individual better off without making another individual worse off

INDICATORS AND PERFORMANCE

GDP     - measure of goods and services produced by a country during a period of time
        - positive trend ( = growth economics)
        - Study of RECESSION = business cycle analysis

Rate of inflation
        - rate of change in prices of goods and services
        - inflation trend to fall during period of recession

Rate of unemployment
        - show human cost of business cycles
        - `

Saving rate 
    - = postpone consumption

MODELS
Used for hypothesing
Testable hypothesis formulated through models
Are simplified version of the reality
Used to understand the forces at play in a market

PUBLIC POLICY
When market fail, there may be a role from the government
ex: FEDERAL RESERVE with monetary policy
Monetary policy = the setting, or influencing, of financial variables by a nation's central bank to manage aggregate spending in the short medium run
Fiscal policy = the setting of government budgetary variables (expenditure, taxation, and public debt)

Aims of policy?
    - rising living standards 
    !!! Access to goods and services (GDP) is not equal to increase standard of living
    - avoid extreme outcome (manage recessions !)
    - keep the value of the currency (avoid inflation, etc)
    - sustainability (repayment of debt without undue hardship )

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, GDP

What is it?
    GDP measures the FLOW of economic activity              
    in a geographic region (usually a country) 
    over a period of time

Q: variable types?
A FLOW is a variable defined over a perdio of time. (ex: income per week, saving per week)
STOCK: a variable defined at a particular point in time (ex total saving, supply of money)
FLOW variables explain changes in STOCK variables

Q: What does economic activity mean?
One of the following representation
(A) Production: flow of goofs and services produced in an economy over a period
(B) Expenditure: the flow of spending undertaken in the economy over a period
(C) Income: The flow of income earned in an economy over a period
!!! They are all the same and will lead to the same results

Q: How to measure economic activity as a flow of production?
raw material 
--(firm1: labour, capital)--> intermediate good 
--(firm2: labor + capital)--> final good                    <-- final good is bought by consumer
with
!!! capital: plant, equipment, computer, ... physical tangible asset
==> only look at the final goods value of sale to compute GDP (otherwise double counting)
OR look at VALUE ADDED from each stage
GDP = SUM OF VALUE ADDED (ie price sold)

Q: What about expenditure?
expenditure 
    = Expenditure on final goods and services to meet IMMEDIATE needs (i.e consumption)
        =
        + households (consumption expenditure on non durable goods) [domestics and imports]
        + government    [ domestics and imports ]
        + foreigners   [ purchase exports ]
    + Expenditure on final goods and services to meet needs in the FUTURE (aka INVESTMENTS)
        =
        + households (consumption expenditure on durable goods) [domestic and imports]
        + FIRMS 
            + Plat and equipment
            + inventory of unsold stocks        <-- available to meet demand in the future
            + domestic supply / imports
        + Government
GDP = expenditure on final goods or services(ie price bought)
 
Y =                                         <-- EXPENDITURE FORMULA
    + sold domestically 
        + Cd                                <-- household consumption (domestic)
        + G                                 <-- government expenditure
        + I                                 <-- firm investment
    + sold to other country as exports
        + X                                 <-- net exports? No EXPORTS

!!! Simplification of model, assume:
        - FIRMS = the only sector that engages in investment
        - HOUSEHOLDS = the only sector that purchases imports 

Q: GDP a measure of income?
Firm produce and sell its production
    + sale receipts of firm 
        + wages
        + interests on past loans
        + rents
        + dividends
        + government taxes
        + depreciation allowance
        + the rest ( = retained earnings)
Households
    + wages, dividends
    - interest, rent
    + household savings
    + government taxes
    + household expenses
Government
    + tax from firms and households
    - govenment expenditure 
    + government saving
Y = business saving + household income + business tax payments
!!! view as FIRMS is the source of income (which is distributed to households and government)

Y =                                             <-- income equation
    + Sb            <-- retained earnings
    + Sh            <-- household saving        <-- Sb + Sh = total saving
    + Cd            <-- consumer consumption
    + M             <-- import
    + T             <-- total households + firms taxes
!!! Household interest payments?


Q: If I buy a house and resell it with a plus value, is this additional plus value added to GDP?
(assume nothing in the house has changed as I sell it the next day )


Y = value of production over a perdio or GDP


Q: What isn't an expenditure included in the national income accounting identity?
GDP can be considered a measure of expenditure on goods and services in a home economy. 
Transfer payments relate to the re-distribution of income in an economy (ie, social welfare) 
so there is no direct exchange of goods and services.




I =                     <-- investment undertaken by firms
    + ( T - G)          <-- budget surplus/deficit, i.e government saving
    + S                 <-- total saving
    + ( M -X )

!!! National Saving NS = (T -G ) + S            <-- saving of private (Sh + Sb) and public sectors
==> I - NS = ( M - X) 


Gap between imports and exports
=> goods manufactured by USA are not attractive to the world?   
==> Why is there such a difference between NS and I ?
