# User Instructions:
#
# Modify the the search function so that it becomes
# an A* search algorithm as defined in the previous
# lectures.
#
# Your function should return the expanded grid
# which shows, for each element, the count when
# it was expanded or -1 if the element was never expanded.
#
# Your function only needs to work for a 5x6 grid.
# You do not need to modify the heuristic.
