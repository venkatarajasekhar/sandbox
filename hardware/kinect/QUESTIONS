Q: Kinect detected?
lsusb
but no label...

Q: Test 'processing' with kinect?
Once processing is installed, from the GUI menu download
3rd party software: OpenKinect
!!! As far as I can tell no example is provided...
!!! OpenKinect library is based on libfreenect (supported by community)
!!! SimpleOpenNI library is based on OpenNI (developed by community but based on official SDK)

Q: what is the difference between OpenKinect and OpenNI?
OpenKinect is a community of people, not a library. 
The OpenKinect community releases the libfreenect Kinect driver. 
libfreenect and OpenNI+SensorKinect are two competing, opensource libraries/drivers. 
libfreenect (Apache 2.0 or GPLv2) derives from the initial, reverse-engineered/hacked Kinect driver 
whereas OpenNI+SensorKinect is derived from open sourced (LGPL) PrimeSense code.
Both projects work on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OS X. 
Both projects allow you to access color and depth images from the camera. 
The projects are not compatible and they can not be used simultaneously.
Differences between the libraries are motor control (libfreenect has it, OpenNI+SensorKinect doesn't), 
and integration with the NITE middleware for higher-level NUI support (OpenNI+SensorKinect only). i
These differences tend to drive projects towards one of the libraries.

Q: Programming languages?

OpenNI (Official SDK): C++, C#, or Visual Basic by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
OpenKinect: Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp and more! Obviously not requiring Visual Studio.
!!! OpenNI is a C++ interface on linux
