!!! USB3 support for XTION has been improved in latest version of driver
!!! More @ http://reconstructme.net/2012/10/13/asus-xtion-usb-3-0-hotfix/
!!! Firmware may not be compatible with linux (see comments)


Q: How to install the Xtion?
You may want to check the hardware from the windows side first.
I believe the Xtion works only on a USB2 (and not USB3)
That wasn't an issue with my XPS 8300 (as it probably has only USB2 ports)

Q: How to know that the Xtion is connected?
lsusb
but beware there is no label for that USB channel

Q: How to know whether the xtion is active or not?
Look at the IR projector, it should be 'red' in the center
(IR emitter)

Q: Which camera does what?
from left to right, 
IR laser emitter
RGB camera
IR camera i(a.k.a Depth Sensor) 

Q: Issues with drivers on linux?
It seems that only the depth sensor is accessible from processing when using the XTION
With processing, could never access the RGB camera.
!!! The RGB camera is accessible using openni (NiViewer) though.

Q: Bug with SimpleOpenNI?
import SimpleOpenNI.*;

SimpleOpenNI kinect;

void setup()
{
    size(640*2, 480);
    kinect = new SimpleOpenNI(this);
    kinect.enableDepth();
    kinect.enableRGB();
}
void draw()
{ 
    kinect.update();
    image(kinect.depthImage(),0,0);
    //image(kinect.rgbImage(),640,0);       // <-- doesn't work with Xtion
}
