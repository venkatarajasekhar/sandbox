Q: What is Amazon CloudFront?
In Amazon CloudFront, your content is organized into distributions. 
A distribution specifies the location or locations of the original version of your files. 
A distribution has a unique CloudFront.net domain name (e.g. abc123.cloudfront.net) 
that you can use to reference your objects through the global network of edge locations. 
If you wish, you can also map your own domain name (e.g. www.example.com) to your distribution. 
You can create distributions to either download your content using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, 
or stream your content using the RTMP protocol.
