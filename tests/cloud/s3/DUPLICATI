Q Use Reduced Redundancy Storage, or RRS?
Not for backup!

Q: What is Reduced Redundancy Storage, or RRS?
RRS is a storage option within Amazon S3 that enables customers to reduce 
their costs by storing non-critical, reproducible data at lower levels of 
redundancy than Amazon S3’s standard storage. It provides a cost-effective, 
highly available solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably 
stored elsewhere, or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, or other 
processed data that can be easily reproduced. The RRS option stores objects 
on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the 
durability of a typical disk drive, but does not replicate objects as many 
times as standard Amazon S3 storage, and thus is even more cost effective. 
Reduced Redundancy Storage is:
    Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement.
    Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects.
    Designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.
