# AMAZON OFFERING

Q: What do all those acronym mean?
EC2         - Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute
S3          - Amazon Simple Storage Service
EBS         - Amazon Elastic Block Store
SNS         - Amazon Simple Notification Service
Route53     - Authoritative DNS
VPC         - Virtual Private Network 
...
CloudFront  - 1 static repository is mirrored at several geographical locations (closer to end user)

Q: What is EC2?
EC2 Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long term commitments. 
This transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs. 

Q: What is EBS?
~ virtual hard disk
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. 
Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached, and persist independently from the life of an instance. 
Amazon EBS provides highly available, highly reliable, predictable storage volumes 
that can be attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance and exposed as a device within the instance. 
Amazon EBS is particularly suited for applications that require a database, 
file system, or access to raw block level storage.
!!! EBS volumes are managed in the EC2 Management interface

Q: What is S3?
~ Gobal filesystem
Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve 
any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. 
It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive 
data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

Q Difference between EBS and S3?
EBS volumes can only be accessed from an EC2 instance in the same availability zone 
whereas snapshots on S3 can be accessed from any availability zone.
S3 is subject to “eventual consistency”  which means that there may be a delay 
in writes appearing in the system whereas EBS has no consistency delays. 
Also EBS can only be accessed by one machine at a time whereas snapshots on S3 can be shared.

Q: What is SNS?
Amazon SNS provides a simple web services interface and browser-based Management Console 
that can be used to create topics you want to notify applications (or people) about, 
subscribe clients to these topics, publish messages, and have these messages delivered 
over clients’ protocol of choice (i.e. HTTP, email, SMS, etc.). 
Amazon SNS delivers notifications to clients using a “push” mechanism that eliminates 
the need to periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates.

Q: What is Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is an authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service. 
DNS is the system that translates human-readable domain names (example.com) into IP addresses (192.0.2.0). 
With authoritative name servers in data centers all over the world, Route 53 is reliable, scalable, and fast.
You can use Amazon Route 53 for any domain or subdomain that you own. 
Creating a domain that uses Route 53 requires only a few easy steps:
1. Register your domain name with a domain name registrar. For a list of the registrars that you can use to register your domain name, go to ICANN.org.
2. In the Route 53 console, create a hosted zone.
3. Using the tools provided by your domain name registrar, update the registrar's name server (NS) records with the four name servers that we assigned to your Route 53 hosted zone. Name servers are listed in the Route 53 console.
4. In the Route 53 console, add record sets to your hosted zone.

Q: What is VPC?
Virtual Private Network
supports Hardware VPNs (using IPSec)
public and private subnet
and static or BGP routine
!!! public subnet is accessible by everyone on the web
!!! private network can be accessed by public subnet? or through VPN

Q: What is Amazon CloudFront?
In Amazon CloudFront, your content is organized into distributions. 
A distribution specifies the location or locations of the original version of your files. 
A distribution has a unique CloudFront.net domain name (e.g. abc123.cloudfront.net) 
that you can use to reference your objects through the global network of edge locations. 
If you wish, you can also map your own domain name (e.g. www.example.com) to your distribution. 
You can create distributions to either download your content using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, 
or stream your content using the RTMP protocol.

Q: What is Glacier?
Amazon Glacier is a low-cost, secure and easy-to-use archiving storage service.
To start using Amazon Glacier, create a vault. Vaults allow you to organize your data, configure access controls and set notification policies.

# ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER

Q: What is are the available account identifiers?
Acccount identifiers are used to share resources between accounts.
There are 2 types:
(1) canonical user ID
44cc967c503ea6ce75c824855df23fd52b80e5e67c3015210790745a73dd3109 
(2) AWS account ID  
7701-9467-1265
The AWS account ID can be used for all AWS service resources except Amazon S3. 
These resources include Amazon EC2 AMIs, Amazon EBS snapshots, Amazon SQS queues, etc.

# ACCESS CREDENTIALS

Q: Types of access credentials?
There are three types of access credentials used to authenticate your requests to AWS services: i
(a) access keys, 
(b) X.509 certificates, 
(c) key pairs. Each access credential type is explained below.

Q: What are access keys used for?
Use access keys to make secure REST or Query protocol requests to any AWS service API. 
AWS create one for you when your account was created.
More @ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#AccessKeys

Q: What are X.509 credentials?
X.509 certificates are based on the idea of public key cryptography.
They are used with the SOAP API
More @ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#X509Credentials

Q: Amazon EC2 Key Pairs?
You use an Amazon EC2 key pair each time you launch an EC2 Linux/UNIX or Windows instance. 
The key pair ensures that only you have access to the instance.
Their purpose : Launching and connecting to Amazon EC2 instances
More @ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#EC2KeyPairs

# SIGN-IN CREDENTIAL

Q: what is the difference with acccess credentials?
To sign in to AWS web sites and applications, AWS requires your Amazon e-mail address and password.
Additionally, it supports the AWS Multi-Factor Authentication option
Amazon Web Services Multi-Factor Authentication needs to be enabled for a particular account. 

Q: What is Amazon Web Services Multi-Factor Authentication?
This is an optional credential that allows you to increase the level of your account security. 
To add this security option to your account, you will need to purchase a compatible authentication device from Gemalto, a third-party provider. 
To purchase a device go to the Gemalto website.

# IAM ?

Q: What are AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM?
IAM enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. 
Using IAM you can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their permissions to AWS resources.
!!! Similar to /etc/passwd and /etc/group and selinux (policy)
Example: Allow EmmanuelMayssat access to AWS_Administrator 

Q: what about passwords?
Before you create your first password, you should modify the default
password policy. Recommended policy is 8 char min with at least 1 uppercase, 
1 lowercase, 1 numeric, and 1 non-alpha characters
Once this policy is put in place, select a user and create his/her password

Q: What about user access key?
Access keys are required if you want to have your AWS privilege without using the 
web interface ( such as programming interface or a 3rd party program)
!!! Only when the credentials are created can they be downloaded (?)
ex: Duplicati, a backup program, doesn't need a password, but security credentials

Q: What are IAM best practice?
Do not use your AWS root account credentials (access key and secret key). 
Instead create an administrator group and an IAM for yourself!
More @ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html
!!! Limit the use of the root account (as on a unix system)

Q: Where can the administrator manage the IAM?
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home
