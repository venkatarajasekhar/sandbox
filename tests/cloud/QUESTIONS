Q: What is EC2?
EC2 Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long term commitments. 
This transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs. 

Q: What is EBS?
~ virtual hard disk
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. 
Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached, and persist independently from the life of an instance. 
Amazon EBS provides highly available, highly reliable, predictable storage volumes 
that can be attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance and exposed as a device within the instance. 
Amazon EBS is particularly suited for applications that require a database, 
file system, or access to raw block level storage.

Q: What is S3?
~ Gobal filesystem
Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve 
any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. 
It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive 
data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

Q Difference between EBS and S3?
EBS volumes can only be accessed from an EC2 instance in the same availability zone 
whereas snapshots on S3 can be accessed from any availability zone.
S3 is subject to “eventual consistency”  which means that there may be a delay 
in writes appearing in the system whereas EBS has no consistency delays. 
Also EBS can only be accessed by one machine at a time whereas snapshots on S3 can be shared.
