Q: Where are my disks?
They are listed as /dev/sdf in EBC web interface
On Ubuntu, you need to create a partition and format it before mounting it!
The names are also not the same for some readon!
For /dev/sdf use /dev/xvdf

Q: What is the procedure to make it appear on my machine?
fdisk /dev/xvdf
mkfs.ext3 /dev/xvdf1
mkdir /mnt/filesystem_1
moount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/filesystem_1
