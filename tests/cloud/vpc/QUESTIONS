Q: VPC?
Virtual Private Cloud

Q: Create a VPC?
Go to amazon VPC service page.
Create a VPC by choosing a CIDR block.
10.0.0.0/16 
Then select a tenancy { default | dedicated }
!!! You cannot create a VPC larger than /16
!!! As a result, you can have 256 VPCs (10.0 to 10.255)

Q: Add subnet to the VPC?
1) Select a VPC to whom that subnet belows to.
2) Select an availability zone
3) Choose a CIDR block for the subnet
!!! CIDR addresses for subnets must have the form 10.0.0.0/24 
!!! Netmask must be between 16 and 28
!!! Subnet should also be within the VPC's 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR

Q: Add computers to a VPC?
Create the instance and attach it to a subnet of the VPC
!!! Before assigning a public IP to the EC2 instance, the VPC needs to have an INTERNET gateway

Q: VPC cannot access the network!
Once the VPc and its subnets have been created, you need to attach an INTERNET gateway!
If no iINTERNET gateway is attached to the VPC, then you cannot allocate public IP 
(Elastic IP) to the attached EC2 instances!
!!! There are other types of gateway (like the virtual private gateway)

Q: How to add and use an INTERNET gateway?
To create the gateway, go to the gateway page!!
But for the gateway to be usable, you need to update the EC2 instance routing tables
To do so, go n the Route Tables section, and add a default route
If destination is not yet matched (0.0.0.0/0), use the gateway

# Security?

Q: Cannot access my machine?
* Check the VPC network ACL
* Check the EC2 instance security policy
* Check the routing tables (is there a default route)
* Is the subnet associated with the aforementioned routing table?

# VPN

Q: What is IPSec ?
IPSec is a protocol used to establish a VPN
To establish a VPN, yuo need a Customer Gateway (remote gateway of the VPN)
and a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG).
The VPG is assigned to the amazon VPC

Q: What is BGP?
Border Gateway Protocol
I believe it can be used by 2 gateways on different networks (i.e through VPN?)
to identify which IP is on which side of the VPN
