Q: Where is the admin console?
http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin/datastore

Q: What is the purpose of escaping?
Python process input string without knowing that it is HTML.
If not escaped, the user can manipulate the HTML
ex: > shouldn't be part of the input (well unless it is escaped)
"   --> &quot;
&   --> &amp;
etc

Q: What is the problem with a POST returning content?
If page is reloaded, the browser resumit the form (POST is resent).
If you save the URL of the success page, this URL points to the form.
As a matter of fact, the form html page will be returned instead of the success page
==> Always use a redirect (bounce the user) in a *successfull* POST request
    For non-successfull request, reprint the form with its content

Q: Give me a brief intro to the datastore.
Tables are call entities in GAE
Columns are not fixed, i.e entries of the same entities do not have to use the same columns
i==> You can change the columns as you are developing
Every entities have an ID
Entities have a notion of parents and ancestors
ex:
Reddit --> link
Give me all the link of reddit
==> get familiar with the docs

Q: What is GQL?
GQL is a simplified version of SQL

Q: How does GQL compare to SQL?
All queries starts with SELECT *
- no joins possible

Run arbitrary quereis
All queries must be indexed
==? indexes are build for us

Q: Is GAE datastore sharded and replicated?
Yes
* No need to think about scaling (too much)
* queries will be quick (because they have to be simle)
* will have to think about consistency

Q: What are datastore types?
Interger, Float, String, Date, Time, DateTime, Email, Link, PostlaAddress, Text, Boolean, etc.

Note that String < 500 chars and is indexes
while Text > 500 chars and NOT indexes <-- cannot be queried

class Art(db.Model):                                    <-- name of the table
    title = db.StringProperty(required=True)            <-- Mandatory field enforced in db (otherwise exception)
    art = db.TextProperty(required=True)
    created_at = db.DateTime(auto_now_add = True)

Q: How to query the database?
cursor_arts = db.GqlQuery("SELECT * FROM Art order created_at desc")
!!! All GQL queries start with select *
!!! Art is the name of the class/table
In template:
{% for art in cursor_arts %} 
    <h1>{{art.title}}</h1>
    <pre>{{art.art}}</pre>
{% endfor %}
