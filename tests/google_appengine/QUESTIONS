Q: What is the purpose of escaping?
Python process input string without knowing that it is HTML.
If not escaped, the user can manipulate the HTML
ex: > shouldn't be part of the input (well unless it is escaped)
"   --> &quot;
&   --> &amp;
etc

Q: What is the problem with a POST returning content?
If page is reloaded, the browser resumit the form (POST is resent).
If you save the URL of the success page, this URL points to the form.
As a matter of fact, the form html page will be returned instead of the success page
==> Always use a redirect (bounce the user) in a *successfull* POST request
    For non-successfull request, reprint the form with its content
