Q: Join SQL query?

SELECT link.* FROM link,user WHERE link.user_id = user.id AND user.name = 'emayssat'

Q: What are indexes?
Is just like an index in the book.
They make lookup faster.
==> indexes increase the speed of queries

Usually you have to iterate over the entire list and see if a row matches our constraint (i.e. ID = 3).
That takes a lot of time if the table is big.
If we want to make the database fast ==> use a b tree, i.e an hash table (in python = a dict ).
