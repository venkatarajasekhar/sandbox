Q: Mysql configuration file?
This file, entitled my.cnf, stores default startup options for both the server and for clients. 
Correct configuration of this file can go a long way towards optimizing MySQL, 
as various memory buffer settings and other valuable options can be set here.
/etc/my.cnf         - global config
~/.my.cnf           - user specific config
/usr/local/mysql/data - for a binary installed database
/usr/local/var      - for a source installed database
 Keep in mind that even if MySQL does locate a my.cnf file in /etc/my.cnf (global to all MySQL servers on that machine), 
it will continue its search for a server-specific file, and then a user-specific file. 
You can think of the final configuration settings as being the result of the /etc/my.cnf, mysql-data-dir/my.cnf, and ~/.my.cnf files.
