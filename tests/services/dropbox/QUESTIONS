Q: Dropbox and S3?
Because Dropbox uses Amazon S3 as its back end, 
it encrypts files with AES-256 before transfer over an SSL-secured link. 
And Dropbox says that its admins "are prohibited from viewing the content 
of files you store in your Dropbox account, and are only permitted to view file metadata".
