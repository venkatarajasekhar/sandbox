Q: What is JPEG?
jpeg = Joint Photographic Experts Group
- lossy compression: Information discarded in the compression is information that the human eye cannot detect
- 16 million colors; best suited for photographs and complex graphics
- compression compromise: file size vs quality

!!! Not good for drawings, lettering or simple graphics because there is not a lot of image that can be thrown out in the lossy process
--> image loses clarity and sharpness


Q: What is GIF?
iGIF = Graphics Interexchange Format
- lossless compression
- 256 colors only
- better than JPG for images with only a few distinct colors (line drawings, black and white, small text)
- animated GIF possible
- support transparency
- proprietary algorithm that expired in 2001


Q: What is PNG?
PNG = Portable Network Graphics
- patent-free
- lossless
- better compression than GIF (5% to 25%)
- allow transparency
- allow control of degree of transparency (i.e opacity)
- does not support animation
