Q: Simplest form?

<form>
    <input name="q">
</form>

When you press enter, the URL changes with the input text
?q=text 
is appended to the URL (by default the form submit to itself)

Q: Submit form?
<form>
    <input name='q'>
    <input type='submit'>
</form>
Clicking submit is NOT any different that pressing enter in the first form

Q: How to change where the form submits to?
<form action="http://www.google.com/search">
    <input name='q'>
    <input type='submit'>
</form>
When submit is pressed, the browser goes to google search results
URL: http://www.google.com/search?q=better+flight+search%21                    <-- URL encoding/escaping turned spaces into +, ? into %21
