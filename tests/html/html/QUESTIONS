Q: What is the  <!DOCTYPE HTML> tag for?
It specify that the content of the file is HTML5
This tag should appear at the very top of the html file (before the <html> tag !)

Q: What about the following head-tag: 
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"> ?
Specify the character encoding.
This is used to tell the web browser which character set of letters to use, 
such as the A to Z alphabet, Hebrew characters, Japanes, Crullic , or some other set.

Q: Is the following tag valid?
<a href="#">Toy</a>
The  pound sign acts as a placeholder.
It works just like a read URL except that it doesn't go anywhere
or cause an error message.

Q: Why is pixel density important?
In CSS you can set the 
max-width:480px
for an iphone with 480-pixel horizontal resolution
The resolution depends on the number of pixels relative to the size of the dispaly area.
Pixel density or pixels per inch (PPI) is more important that than the number of pixles.
iPhone 3GS: 132 PPI for 480x320 screen resolution
iPhone 4:   326 PPI for 960x640 screen resolution
DEsktop:     99 PPI on a 20 inch screen
==> a width setting of 480px will show up as coming only about halfway on the iPhone4 even though it fills the width of the iphone3
