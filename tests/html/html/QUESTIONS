Q: What is the  <!DOCTYPE HTML> tag for?
It specify that the content of the file is HTML5
This tag should appear at the very top of the html file (before the <html> tag !)

Q: What about the following head-tag: 
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"> ?
Specify the character encoding.
This is used to tell the web browser which character set of letters to use, 
such as the A to Z alphabet, Hebrew characters, Japanes, Crullic , or some other set.

Q: Is the following tag valid?
<a href="#">Toy</a>
The  pound sign acts as a placeholder.
It works just like a read URL except that it doesn't go anywhere
or cause an error message.
