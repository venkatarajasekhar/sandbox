Q: What is the purpose of jquery?
Simplify Javascript when it comes to interaction 

Q: What is 'this' ?
The keyword 'this' refers to the DOM element to which the behavior was attached.
By writting $('this') within the event handler, we create a jQuery object corresponding to the element,
and can act on it just as if we had located it with a CSS selector.

Q: What is the $ sign?
$ is just a name.
Names in Javascript can contain dollar signs, and can consist of just a dollar sign.
There's nothing special about the dollar sign, except that jQuery defines a function called $

Q: How to make Jquery play well with other JS lib?
In JQuery, the dollar sign is simply an alias for jquery.
As a $() function is very common in JS lib, conflicts could arise if more than one of these libs were being used in a given page.
Avoid conflicts by replacing every instance of $ with jQuery in custom jquery code.
<script> src="prototype.js"></script>
<script> src="jquery.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery.noConflict();                <-- return control of the $ identifer back to other libraries
</script>

jQuery(document).ready( function($) {
})

Q: How to setup JQuery in my HTML
<head>
    <script src="jquery.js"></script>
</head>

Q: What is $(function ...) ?
$(document).ready() construct is actually calling the .ready() method on a JQuery object we have consotructed from the document DOM element.
The $() function provides a shortcut for us as this is a common task.
When we pass in a function as the argument, jQuery performs an implicit call to .ready()

$(function() {...});                ==          $(document).ready(function() {...});

Q: How to bind a button event to a function?
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#switcher-large').bind('click', function() {
        $('body').addClass('large');
        $('body').removeClass('narrow');
        $('switcher button').removeClass('selected');
        $('this').addClass('selected');
    });
    $('#switcher-default').bind('click', function() {
        ...
    });
});

Q: How to read consolidated method statements?

$('body').removeClass().addClass('large')
is read from left to right or is equivalent to 
$('body').removeClass()                                         <-- remove all the classes
$('body').addClass('large')

Q: How do multi-event handlers work?
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#switcher button').bind('click', function () { ... });   <-- If some elements are matched several times, the event handlers
    $('#switcher-narrow').bind('click', function () { ... });   <-- are run in the order they were entered
});

Q: What are shorthand events?
$('button').bind('click', function() {...}) can be rewritten $('button').click(function() {...})
This is valid for the following events:
blur, change, click, dblclick, error, focus, keydown, keyup, load, mousedown, mousemove, 
mouseout, mouseover, mouseup, resize, scroll, select, submit, unload

Q: difference between .toggle and .click ?
$('#switcher h3').toggle(function() { ... }, function() {...}, function() {...});
==> For each click on h3 (not a button!!!), execute function 1, then function2, then ...
