Q: Where is the admin console?
http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin/datastore
You can  
* Datastore Viewer          - view or create entries in the datastore
* Datastore Indexes
* Datastore Stats
* Interactive Console       - run python code interactively
* Memcache Viewer
* Task Queues
* Cron Jobs
* XMPP
* Inbound Mail
* Backends
* Text Search

Q: is the admin console available on GAE? 
Yes! This is the dashboard!
https://appengine.google.com/dashboard

Q: What is the purpose of escaping?
Python process input string without knowing that it is HTML.
If not escaped, the user can manipulate the HTML
ex: > shouldn't be part of the input (well unless it is escaped)
"   --> &quot;
&   --> &amp;
etc

Q: What is the problem with a POST returning content?
If page is reloaded, the browser resumit the form (POST is resent).
If you save the URL of the success page, this URL points to the form.
As a matter of fact, the form html page will be returned instead of the success page
==> Always use a redirect (bounce the user) in a *successfull* POST request
    For non-successfull request, reprint the form with its content

Q: Give me a brief intro to the datastore.
Tables are call entities in GAE
Columns are not fixed, i.e entries of the same entities do not have to use the same columns
i==> You can change the columns as you are developing
Every entities have an ID
Entities have a notion of parents and ancestors
ex:
Reddit --> link
Give me all the link of reddit
==> get familiar with the docs

Q: What is GQL?
GQL is a simplified version of SQL

Q: How does GQL compare to SQL?
All queries starts with SELECT *
- no joins possible

Run arbitrary queries
All queries must be indexed
==? indexes are build for us

Q: Is GAE datastore sharded and replicated?
Yes
* No need to think about scaling (too much)
* queries will be quick (because they have to be simle)
* will have to think about consistency

Q: What are datastore types?
Interger, Float, String, Date, Time, DateTime, Email, Link, PostlaAddress, Text, Boolean, etc.

Note that String < 500 chars, is indexed, and cannot contain carriage return.
while Text > 500 chars and NOT indexes <-- cannot be queried

class Art(db.Model):                                    <-- name of the table
    title = db.StringProperty(required=True)            <-- Mandatory field enforced in db (otherwise exception)
    art = db.TextProperty(required=True)
    created_at = db.DateTime(auto_now_add = True)

Q: How to query the database?
cursor_arts = db.GqlQuery("SELECT * FROM Art order created_at desc")
!!! All GQL queries start with select *
!!! Art is the name of the class/table
In template:
{% for post in posts %} 
    <h1>{{post.subject}}</h1>
    <p>{{post.content}}</p>
{% endfor %}

Q: What is a permalink?
In a blog, you have several posts.
A permalink is URL that link a particular post.
http://www.example.com/blog/posts/123       
Is a URL to the post with ID 123.
Note that ID can be strings

Q: Which standard libraries are supported in GAE?
Most of the standard python libraries are supported
http://docs.python.org/modindex.html
but a few
https://developers.google.com/appengine/kb/libraries

    ctypes          - C to python - A foreign function library for Python.
    sqlite          - Unsupported database = A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.
    ssl/_ssl        - ??? - TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects
    fcntl           - Unix specific = The fcntl() and ioctl() system calls
    spwd            - Unix specific = The shadow password database (getspnam() and friends)
    pwd             - Unix specific 
    grp             - unix specific = The group database (getgrnam() and friends)
    syslog          - Unix specific = An interface to the Unix syslog library routines.
    select          - ??? - Wait for I/O completion on multiple streams.
    _socket         - ??? - Low-level networking interface.

Note that to use the supported standard python libraries, you do not need to put them in the yaml file

  
Q: Which 3rd party libraries are supported in GAE? 
The App Engine Python 2.7 runtime includes several third-party libraries that your application can use.
Go in the google_appengine directory are look in the .../lib directory
Those supported libraries are 3rd party.
To include those libs in your code, you MUST modify the app.yaml file.

Q: When do we cache?
caching = storing results of operations so that future requests return faster
- computation is slow
- computation will run multiple times
- when the output is the same for a partuclar input
- your provider charges for db access

Q: What is a cache hit?
If the result of a requested operation is in the cache. then it is a catch-hit

Q: What is a cache miss?
If the result of a requested  operation is not in the cache, then it is it is called a cache-miss!
