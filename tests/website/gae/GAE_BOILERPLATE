Q: wtforms?
Doc @ http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/1.0.2/
To make the for accessible in the template, in the handler add the method/property
from web import forms
class MyHandler(BaseHandler):
    @webapp2_extras.property
    def form(self):
        return forms.MyForm(self)
In the template, form fields are accessible like form.email
    {{ form.email(required=True, class="toto") }} is the widget assiciated with the type
    {{ form.email.errors }} is a list of all the validation errors
    !!! A macro has been written to facilitate the construction of horizontal? forms


In handler.post
    form.validate() return True or False and populate field.error
    If not form.validate(): self.get()  , but with form.fields.errors set
    You can have several errors. One error for each of the validator
   
Q: Cookies?
Cookies are managed by the client.
user_id         1|<hash>                    
hl              en_US                       use for locale
dvc             desktop
session                                     save a session or session id
session_name
_atshc
__atuvc

Q: Sessions?
Session are managed by the server.
A session is a python dictionary attached to a particular IP-UserAgent?
As such, variables related to a specific 'connection' can be saved  (on the server side)
The session expires (time parameter?) (or is brought down by the client? when session is invalid!)
More @ http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/api/webapp2_extras/sessions.html

Q: CSRF protection?
CSRF is a session variable
If the session variiable is not the same as the post.request parameter, 
then the client (IP/UserAgent) is not who he says he is !
