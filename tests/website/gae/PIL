Q: How to access the image height?

1/
avatar = db.BlobProperty()

If the image is stored in a BlobProperty, 
then the data is stored in the datastore, and if profile is your entity, then the height can be accessed as:

from google.appengine.api import images
height = images.Image(image_data=profile.avatar).height

2/
If the image is in the blobstore, (blobstore.BlobReferenceProperty in the datastore), 
then you have 2 ways of doing it, the better way is complicated and requires getting a reader for the blob 
and feeding it to a exif reader to get the size. 

An easier way is:

if avatar = db.BlobReferenceProperty() and profile is your entity, then:

from google.appengine.api import images
img = images.Image(blob_key=str(profile.avatar.key()))

# we must execute a transform to access the width/height
img.im_feeling_lucky() # do a transform, otherwise GAE complains.

# set quality to 1 so the result will fit in 1MB if the image is huge
img.execute_transforms(output_encoding=images.JPEG,quality=1)

#ffix now you can access img.height and img.width
