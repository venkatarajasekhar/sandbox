A Good Place for Kids <br>
<br>
<img src="kid.png" alt="kid" align="left"> Kids are serious business. They need toys that are both safe and educational. Toys need to be fun and allow children's minds to create beyond any functionality the toy has. There is no reason that they cannot be both safe and fun. Children need lots of clothes because they grow so fast. And they need sports to offset childhood obesity and the illnesses associated with obesity. <br>
