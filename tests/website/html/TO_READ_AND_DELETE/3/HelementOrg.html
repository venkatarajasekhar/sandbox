  <h1>by Ludwig Wittgenstein</h1>
  <h2>1 The world is all that is the case.</h2>
  <h3>1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.</h3>
  <h4>1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.</h4>
  <h4>1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.</h4>
  <h4>1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.</h4>
  <h3>1.2 The world divides into facts.</h3>
  <h4>1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else remains the same.</h4>
