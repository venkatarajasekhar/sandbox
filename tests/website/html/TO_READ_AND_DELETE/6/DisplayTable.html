  <section class="col1">During the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, each country was represented by one team. The United States was made up of players from all over the U.S., where soccer has been played by youth teams for the last 40 years. However, soccer has not caught on with the same enthusiasm as the rest of the world—where it is known as "football." Nevertheless, the U.S. team did  well, winning its class in the first round of play.</section>
  <section class="col2"> One of the few nations that has more than a single country represented in World Cup play is the United Kingdom. In the first round of play, the United States and England, represented by the St. George flag (rather than the Union Jack), played to a tie. The tie delighted the Americans and dismayed the English. Like the U.S., England made it to the second round, and, like the U.S., they, too, failed to move on to the next level.</section>
