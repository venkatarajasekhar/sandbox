  <h4>&nbsp;Kubla Khan</h4>

<article>
  <hr>
  In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
  Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
  Through caverns measureless to man<br>
  Down to a sunless sea.<br>
  <hr>
  So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
  With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
  And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
  Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
  And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
  Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br>
  <hr>
  But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
  Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
  A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
  As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
  By woman wailing for her demon-lover! </article>
