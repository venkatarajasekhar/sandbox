Q: What is a virtual host?
Two websites have different server names, but whose files are hosted on the same machine.
ex: host.domain.com and www.other_domain.org
1/ The hostname should route to the machine
2/ On the server, hostname should resolve as localhost
3/ Apache needs to have a VirtualHost directive on desired port
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "/path/to/doc/root"
        ServerName host.domain.com
    </VirtualHost>
!!! The VirtualHost directive can contain configuration directives which are specific to that virtual host.
