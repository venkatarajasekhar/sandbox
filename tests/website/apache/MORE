Q: Is mod_rewrite working?

Q: Is my .htaccess accessed?
Did you change the AllowOverride directive ?
did you reload the apache conf?
Put a typo in the htaccess, reload THE PAGE, check the error.log
[Wed Jul 03 18:58:32 2013] [alert] [client 98.248.37.253] /var/www/crowdsets/public/.htaccess: Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
!!! Because .htaccess files are read on every request, changes made in them take effect immeditely

# MOD-WRITE

Q: What is mod-write?
One such module is called mod_rewrite which is responsible for rewriting 
website URLs at the server side. For example, when user asks for 
http://myserver.com/my_category/my_post.html, the requested URL 
is translated by mod_rewrite to 
http://myserver.com/post.php?category=100&post=200, 
which is then handled (processed) by the web server.

Q: Why use mod-rewrite?
Webmasters generally use mod_rewrite to improve user-friendliness 
and search engine friendliness of web sites by letting mod_rewrite 
expose more memorable and crawlable URLs to the world. 
Also, it can help hide any sensitive information such as query strings 
from URL requests, and hence can enhance website safety.

Q: How to check if mod_rewrite is enabled?
ls -al /etc/apache/mods-enabled/*
You should see
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 30 Dec  9 23:10   /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load -> ../mods-available/rewrite.load

Q: How to enable mod_write?
* cat /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load
* sudo a2enmod rewrite
    This command create a symbolic link in /etc/pache2/mods-enabled
* sudo service apache2 restart
!!! On ubunbu, mod-write is installed but not enabled by default
