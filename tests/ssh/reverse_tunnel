A reverse tunnel is when you are behind a firewall that has no SSH server, 
but need to access it at a later date (be it minutes/hours/days later) 
but don't want or have the ability to VPN in. 

The idea: You establish the ssh tunnel by connecting to your remote ssh server.
Later, from that remote ssh server, you can log back in.

You would connect to your SSH server from that machine, 
then reverse the tunnel by connecting to that open connection. 
What do I use it for? 
From time to time against a server, or even with friends and family with reverse 
VNC sessions via SSH tunnels. 
In this case they execute a putty saved session that logs into my ssh server as a certain user with no rights. 
Once the tunnel is established, I can vnc to their machine in order to remote to them. i
No more having them setup their firewall, or figure out log-me-in, or any of those other websites.

So the steps to create a reverse SSH tunnel are as follows:

From client machine: ssh -R remoteport:localhost:22 username@servername
ex: ssh -R 2048:localhost:22 bob@mylinuxserver.xxx
From server side (to re-establish the tunnel): ssh -p 2048 localhost
