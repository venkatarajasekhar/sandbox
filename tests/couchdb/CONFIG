ouchDB listens on the 5984 port by default                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CouchDB only binds to localhost. It's not pre-configured for outside access by default.

ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHTS
---------------------
After the installation of couchdb, everyone is administrator.
To fix this, open futon and at the bottom right click 'Fix this'.
This operation will prompt you on for a username and password that will be given administration rights.
Note that this operation make the REST interface require authentication.

You can create several administrators.
Note that the list of administrators is available by clicking on the Configuration tab.

URL become http://username:pass@remotehost:5984/demo

The _users database is also updated with a new entry for each administrator.
It seems also that test_suite_db and test_suite_db/with_slashes databases are created.
